# HR-Data-Analysis-Project
HR Data Analysis Project Using Excel, SQL and Power BI

## Context:
This project was a freestyle learning initiative where I utilized an HR dataset to perform end-to-end data analysis. The focus was on leveraging my knowledge of data cleaning, SQL, and Power BI to uncover actionable insights. With no predefined problem statement or task, this project allowed me to independently explore and apply analytical skills in a simulated real-world scenario.

Challenges and Objectives:
The primary objective was to extract meaningful insights and key performance indicators (KPIs) from the dataset, while ensuring data quality and presenting findings through compelling visualizations. This required:
Cleaning and preparing the raw HR dataset to ensure analytical accuracy.
Designing SQL queries to generate insights across multiple dimensions (time, employee attributes, geography, and recruitment sources).
Building an interactive Power BI dashboard to communicate findings effectively.

## Actions Taken:

Data Preparation and Cleaning:
Processed the raw dataset in Excel, addressing inconsistencies and ensuring clean, structured data.
Standardized formats, removed duplicates, and prepared data for SQL-based analysis.
Data Analysis and Insight Generation:
Utilized SQL to explore and analyze key trends and patterns in the HR dataset, focusing on areas such as:
Monthly and yearly hiring trends.
Employee demographics (age, gender, marital status, and geography).
Recruitment sources and employee satisfaction levels.
Designed complex queries to calculate metrics like total salaries, average salaries by position, and termination reasons.
Identified high and low earners by age, position, and individual names.

Visualization Development:
Developed a dynamic and interactive dashboard in Power BI to visualize KPIs and insights.
Created visuals to showcase:
Yearly and monthly hiring trends.
Employee distributions by position, age group, and gender.
Geographical insights and recruitment source effectiveness.
Employee satisfaction and reasons for termination.

## Results:
Key Metrics Delivered:
Total Salary, Total Employees, Average Salary per Employee, Average Employees per Position, Employees with Leave Over 15 Days, Terminated Employee Count.
Insights Uncovered:
Hiring Trends: Peak hiring observed in January, July, and September, with 2011-2014 recording the maximum hirings.

Demographics:
56% of employees are female.
90% of employees are between 23 to 50 years old.
88% of employees are from MA state in the USA.
45% of total salaries are earned by single employees.
Employee Satisfaction:
34% of employees rate their satisfaction at 3/5, with 31% at 5/5 and 30% at 4/5.

Position Analysis:
62% of employees are Product Technicians I and II.
Product Technicians I earned 36% of the total salary, while Software Engineer Managers earned only 0.37%.
High and Low Earners:
Highest Earner: Janet King (1% of the total salary).
Lowest Earner: Colleen Zima (0.2% of the total salary).
Employees aged 32 earn the most (6% of salaries), while employees aged 63 earn the least (0.25%).
Recruitment Sources: 27% of employees were recruited via Indeed, followed by 24% via LinkedIn.

Applications:

While this was a personal project, the insights and methodology demonstrated the potential for real-world applications such as:
Optimizing Recruitment Strategies: Insights into effective hiring months and recruitment sources can guide HR efforts.
Workforce Planning: Understanding demographics and satisfaction levels can aid in retention and employee engagement strategies.
Budget Allocation: Salary distribution by position and location helps allocate budgets more effectively.
Performance Review: Patterns in termination and satisfaction reasons provide actionable insights for improving organizational policies.
Dashboards for Decision-Making: The interactive dashboard is scalable to track real-time HR KPIs and provide data-driven decision support.

Skills Utilized:
Data Preparation and Cleaning: Ensured accurate analysis using Excel.
Advanced SQL Analysis: Delivered actionable insights through well-optimized SQL queries.
Visualization Development: Designed a Power BI dashboard to communicate insights effectively.
Trend and Pattern Analysis: Derived meaningful trends and KPIs to inform HR decision-making.

Outcome:
The project demonstrated my ability to handle the full lifecycle of data analysisâ€”from cleaning and preparation to insight generation and visualization. It highlights my skills in SQL, Power BI, and Excel while showcasing my aptitude for identifying and presenting actionable business insights. This freestyle project underscored my ability to apply analytical knowledge to solve real-world problems creatively and effectively.
